## Puppy Love API

Full documentation: https://www.joerezendes.com/projects/puppy-love/docs/#/

### Description
This API allows authenticated users to post their dog's online for other users to search for that specific dog breed.
Think of it like Match Maker but for dog owners to breed their dogs. Also, in the future it will allow users to search
for dog litters to adopt puppies from the breeders.
